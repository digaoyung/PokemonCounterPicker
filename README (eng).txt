In a general way, this will be a bad software, during its early versions. Probably, there are thousands and thousands of similar softwares, which do exactly the same things this app is supposed to do, but in a efficient and optimized way.
By now, you're probably asking "ok, so, if you're aware of this, why creating this app anyway?"
Welp, I'm writing this text on February 2021. Right now, I'm starting to learn programming. So, this software's development will be directly attatched to my progress as a student and programmer. As long as I learn new resources and techniques, they'll be implemented in the software's code, making it better (and probably more useful).
This said, do not take this application as the "new big deal". It's NOT supposed to be so. I don't even intend to make it profitable.
However, if you want to follow a student's process of development by analyzing his code and checking his improvements, be welcome to follow me through this new journey.

VERSION HISTORY
--------------------------------------------------------------------

VERSION 0.0.0.0.4
Release: 02/22/2021 - 8:00 p.m. (GST +3)
A few hours after I published the .3 version, the same friend who suggested the methods gave me other suggestions, which made the code way more organized - and clear (thanks, Kodorna!)
So, the menu became a function after Main, which took off about 2134213 code lines from the main program. This means that I only need to call the function to print the menu.
Also, after watching a class, I "cloned" the "Tipos" class to a "OldTipos" class (because I think it could be useful in the future, and I didn't want to lose it), and I transformed the methods in a huge - AND FUNCTIONAL - switch-case.
With this, ladies and gentlemen, here we have the first ACTUALLY FUNCTIONAL app version.
Yey! \o/

--------------------------------------------------------------------

VERSION 0.0.0.0.3
Release: 02/22/2021
- no big changes
- swapped a 'for' for a 'while', so the software runs while the user wishes
- fixed the returns (though I haven't been able to put them to run yet)
(actually, I simply set how I wish them to return)

--------------------------------------------------------------------


VERSION 0.0.0.0.2
Release: 02/17/2021

- a friend suggested to include the types as methods. At first, I thought it would demand a lot of work, but, I decided to implement it anyway, because I realised it would be in fact easier.
- to do that, I browsed Bulbapedia and gathered the info about the types. However, when I started typing the info, I realized it would be way harder than I thought. For now, I simply added the types and atributes (eg.: dragon suffers 0,5 dmg from fire atks, and 2x dmg from ice atks). However, I but them as commentaries, because it will need a lot of coding to work (and I didn't want to lose the information I gathered).
- talking about types, because of a matter of difficulties + lazyness, FOR NOW, I will only consider generation VI onwards. There are at least 3 different previous counters, and to be honest, I'm not willing to think about this right now.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

VERSION 0.0.0.0.1
Release: 02/11/2021

- first "usable" version
- console-only app. Everything it does is: printing a list with the pokemon types; gettin two numbers; searching in the Type class the equivalent values; printen the chosen types. It does it by using a class because, in the future, I intend to fill this class with the proper information about types, and use it to build the counters.
- (thus said, to make things clear,) yes, I registered ALL the "data base" manualy, which means that I typed the 18 Pokemon types and forced them into a string[].
